## Project: Can country stringency decrease the COVID-19 deaths?  

Using the data published on ourworldindata.org and Machine Learning, we would like to **investigate if the number of COVID-19 deaths can be controled using government stringency measures**.

This project is inspired by the video *"When might the lockdown End?"* by Dr. Andy Thompson (RheumInfo) published in April, 2020 [https://youtu.be/h_EfQdoB5Ro]

In summary, the video suggests that the number of COVID-19 deaths is one of the most reliable indicator of the severety of the COVID-19 infection in a country. Therefore, we can consider that it is safe to end the lockdown if the number of COVID-19 deaths are consistently in the single digits for at least 3 weeks duration.

Similar data is analyzed for *government response tringency index vs biweekly change in confirmed covid-19 cases* [here](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/government-response-stringency-index-vs-biweekly-change-in-confirmed-covid-19-cases). It will be interesting to find out if using the number of deaths instead of change in the confirmed covid-19 deaths will provide better insights.
