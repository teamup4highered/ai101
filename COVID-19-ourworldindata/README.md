## Project: Can country stringency decrease the COVID-19 deaths?  

This project is inspired by the video "When might the lockdown End?" by Dr. Andy Thompson (RheumInfo) published in April, 2020 [https://youtu.be/h_EfQdoB5Ro]

In summary, the number of COVID-19 deaths is one of the most reliable indicator of the severety of the COVID-19 infection in a country. The video suggests that we can consider ending the lockdown if the number of COVID-19 deaths are consistently under 10 for at least 3 weeks duration.  

Using the data published on ourworldindata.org and Machine Learning algorithsm, we would like to investigate if the number of COVID-19 deaths can be controled using government stringency.
